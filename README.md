## Requirements
## Part 1 - Sorting Running times

* [x] Requirement 1: Used a minimum of ten arrays lengths: 50,000 to 500,000
* [x] Requirement 2: For each of the array lengths listed above, generated an array of random double instances. sent a copy of this array to each of the five general-purpose sorting algorithms.
* [x] Requirement 3: Collected the time down to milliseconds required to sort each array using a Java system call such as currentTimeMills()
* [x] Requirement 4: Used the times required by each of the algorithms and the size of the arrays to construct a chart.

## Part 2 - Quicker than Quicksort

* [x] Requirement 1: Finished starter file WiggleSort.java
* [x] Requirement 2: provided the running time analysis of my own code explaining my thought process 
* [x] Requirement 3: provided comments
* [x] Requirement 4: compiled my code and my WiggleSort function is static

* [x] Implimentation: runs successfully with the source files and data provided. produces expected results. no deviation from the expected results.
* [x] Decomposition: solution follows the suggestions provided.
* [x] Style: implementation is well-commented. used intelligently-named variables and functions.
