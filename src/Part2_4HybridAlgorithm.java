/**
 * Hybrid algorithm
 * - calls randomised quicksort on large arrays
 * - calls quadratic sort for smaller arrays
 * - make implementation choice based on the length of the sub-array being sorted
 *
 * idea 1:
 * -> based on the experimental data, randomized quicksort performs O(n lg n) on large arrays.
 * -> need data for justification to see how randomized quicksort and quadratic sort performs on different sizes.
